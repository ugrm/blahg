Hi! I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at GIST. Currently, I am an undergraduate student intern at [MPIL](https://mpil-gist.github.io/).

My research interests are primarily in robotics and perception. Right now, I am working on geometry-based floorplan localization. I aim to advance sensory augmentation for humans and robots, integrating auditory and olfactory sensing beyond human limits to uncover hidden dimensions of the world and new ways to understand it.
