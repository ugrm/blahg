Hi! I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at GIST. Currently, I am an undergraduate student intern at [MPIL](https://mpil-gist.github.io/).

I work at the intersection of robotics and perception, currently focusing on geometry-based floorplan localization. More broadly, I explore sensory augmentation for humans and robots by integrating modalities like sound and smell. I believe our field is limited by anthropocentric bias, and my vision is to let each modality speak in its own terms, revealing dimensions of the world beyond RGB and human intuition.
