Hi! I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at GIST. Currently, I am an undergraduate student intern at [Machine Perception and Intelligence Lab](https://mpil-gist.github.io/).

My research interests are primarily in robotics and perception. Right now, I am working on geometry-based floorplan localization. In the long run, I aim to enhance robotic perception by integrating multiple sensor modalities, including auditory and olfactory inputs, to develop robust and versatile robotic systems.
